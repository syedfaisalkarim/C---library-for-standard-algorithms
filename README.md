It implements most of the generally used algorithms in graph theory,number thoery, string operations(searching and pattern matching), computational geometry and implements classes for fractions, matrices, polynomials and complex numbers. 

This was mostly written for programming contests, so is not very well documented. But beginners can still find it to be very useful for learning the basic algorithm.
